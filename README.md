The track our team has chosen for the hackathon is social awareness. The reason our team has chosen this topic is because weâ€™ve seen many injustice happening around us that needs to be solved quickly in order to insure the growth and well being of the people in our country and planet. 

The problem related to social awareness that we have chosen to work on is the fact that the LGBTQA section of our society still faces problem when it comes to proper identification of their community, whether it is on any forms, documents or in daily life while standing in a queue 

The solution regarding this is the proper education of people on this topic from a young age, more open conversation, conduction of workshop and changes in official reforms and forms.
